Finding the donors for a non profit organization
Predicting the customers who earn more than $50000 for charity donation

Implemented several supervised algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost and Logistics Regression to accurately model individuals income. Chosse the best performing algorithm and optimized it by tuning the model for with different learning rates and number of steps for estimation for optimum performance. Preprocessed the data by applying logarithmic transformation to highly skewed features, normalizing the data and for non-numeric data applied one-hot encoder.
Finally Used metrics such as F-score and Naive predictor to evaluate the performance of the model
